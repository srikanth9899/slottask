# @aelesia/commons

This is a collection of common functions used by me across several different projects. These utilities are generally context agnostic and can be applied to a large variety of applications.

# README

You are free to use this package, or copy code from it. However this package is tailored specifically for my personal usage, so do not expect much support from it.

If a particular function gets popular, I may consider extracting it to a standalone package.
